# chat_app

chat app with audion and video functionalities built using flutter and firebase.

## Getting Started

## how everything works

bindings gets called and controller follows, and if controller gets called then other variables and state variables gets called too and ui becomes reactive. we used the bindings, controllers, and view s format

## middleware

used for conditional check- if user is logged in or not or if user meets certains requirements
